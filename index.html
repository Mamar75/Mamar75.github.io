      My research explores asset pricing, the Law of One Price, and limits to arbitrage—especially when some prices are unobservable.

    <strong>Lost In Transmission</strong> (Job Market Paper) – 
    <p>
      Publicly traded companies sometimes own shares in other publicly traded companies. 
      We refer to the owning company as the <em>parent</em> and the held company as the <em>subsidiary</em>. 
      According to a basic <em>consistency</em> principle, if the value of a parent company's stake in a subsidiary increases by $1 million, 
      the parent company's market value should also increase by $1 million, assuming the rest of the parent company's assets and liabilities remain constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the market value of the parent company’s other assets and liabilities is not directly observable, it likely correlates with the subsidiary’s market value. 
      Therefore, it is crucial to account for common movements unrelated to ownership. Assuming these can be captured by closely related stock price movements, 
      I found that, among a panel of parent–subsidiary pairs, on average, a $1 million weekly increase (or decrease) in the value of a parent company’s stake in a subsidiary 
      results in only a $550,000 weekly increase (or decrease) in the parent company’s market value.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggests that consistency does not hold. The presence of the parent’s other assets limits arbitrage, 
      as it becomes difficult to verify in real time whether consistency holds, and arbitrage positions cannot be perfectly hedged.
      However, when no other assets are present, the transmission rate is indistinguishable from one.
    </p>

    <strong>Indeterminacy: The Ultimate Limit to Arbitrage</strong> – 
    <p>
      Publicly traded parent companies are found to underreact significantly to changes in the value of their publicly traded subsidiaries. This paper presents a model in which such inconsistency is compatible 
      with the absence of excess returns—that is, with no near-arbitrage opportunities—even for risk-neutral arbitrageurs with no capital and under short-selling constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation lies in <em>price indeterminacy</em>: arbitrageurs do not know the fundamental value with certainty and must rely on publicly available prices to guide their trades. Suppose that the stock 
      price of the subsidiary contains some noise—fluctuations either driven by inattentive traders or by reasons unrelated to fundamentals, and that, in the absence of arbitrage, would not transmit to the parent. 
      If the parent also holds other assets that are not independently tradable, any movement in the subsidiary’s value that fails to transmit to the parent can just as well be interpreted as an offsetting movement 
      in the parent’s other, unobservable assets. This ambiguity limits arbitrage, since it becomes impossible to verify in real time whether the inconsistency reflects mispricing or merely a revaluation of the rest 
      of the parent’s portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, the inconsistency between the subsidiary’s value and the parent’s market valuation is not directly visible in real time. However, across many states of the world, an econometrician can estimate 
      the average underreaction. Meanwhile, arbitrage activity ensures that any <strong>exploitable</strong> inconsistency—one that would otherwise generate excess returns—is traded away, thereby limiting the 
      remaining degree of inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when an event occurs that forces a correction—such as an equity carve-out—risk-neutral arbitrageurs will trade until the expected correction is fully neutralized. If they are risk-averse, they 
      trade only up to the point where the expected return compensates for the risk of being wrong about the size or direction of the correction. In both cases, the underreaction persists, although risk-neutrality 
      substantially limits its magnitude.
    </p>

    <strong>Valuation Consistency in the Equity Market: When It Tends to Hold and When It Might Not</strong> – 
    <p>
      This paper investigates a subtle but pervasive limit to arbitrage: <strong>ambiguity</strong>. I focus on Negative Stub Values (NSVs)—situations in which a publicly traded parent company is worth less than its stake in a publicly traded subsidiary. While NSVs are often viewed as signs of mispricing, this is not always justified. The analysis distinguishes between <em>verifiable</em> and <em>non-verifiable</em> NSVs, depending on whether the value of the parent’s other assets can be inferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the verifiable cases, where the parent holds few or no other assets, I find that valuation consistency holds to a satisfactory degree. In contrast, non-verifiable NSVs appear more suspicious: large discrepancies are observed, and in several cases, multibillion-dollar corrections follow events such as equity carve-outs. These corrections suggest that arbitrage was limited not by capital or short-selling constraints, but by uncertainty about whether mispricing truly existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The findings provide empirical support for the conjecture of Brav and Heaton: when rationality and irrationality are hard to distinguish, mispricing can persist—not because arbitrage is impossible, but because arbitrageurs cannot be certain it is warranted.
